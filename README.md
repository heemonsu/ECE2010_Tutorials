This repository contains experimental code in preparation for some of the topics are a part of the ECE2010 Intro to ECE course at WPI.

### Ideas/Checklist
1. Write sample code to compare performance of C and MATLAB, prove that MATLAB is in fact slower for for loops. __Completed__
2. Create MATLAB sample function for elementwise operations.
3. Create C sample function for elementwise operations.
4. Write the details of making a function compatible for use as MEX file.
5. Convert the C sample to a MEX file to be used in MATALB.
